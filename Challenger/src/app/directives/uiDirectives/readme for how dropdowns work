How the dropdown system works.


There are currently at the time of writting two dropdown direvtives

hamburger-on-click.directive.ts (used for controling nav menus that collapse on 'collapse' being added to their class)

dropdown-on-click.directive.ts (used for controlling comment page dropdowns)


How they work:
On button click they trigger a function in their .ts files. This function
uses the ui 'standardComs' service to pass an the element ID of the dropdown being referenced.

Because the element ID for the comments are actually composed of the unique commentID the value being passed
using the service is actually unique to each comment object.

The service then emits the unique element ID to all listeners (that is all UI elements).

All directive elements are listening to the global UI coms ervice, and thus when they 'hear' this emission they check their current
id (the id of the element their attached to) with the id being emitted. IF it IS them, they trigger.
